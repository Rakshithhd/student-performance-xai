# Student Performance Prediction with Explainable AI & Fairness

Welcome to the central repository for our final year thesis research. This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (LSTM, Diffusion Models), while emphasizing model explainability (SHAP, LIME) and fairness.

## 🏗️ Project Structure Overview
1. `CodeBase`
This is the "Clean Room." Only finalized code goes here.
- `data/`: Raw datasets (student-mat.csv, student-por.csv).
- `src/`: Source code, notebooks, and main scripts.
- `result/`: Model performance CSVs and outputs.

2. `Literature` (Collaborator Workspaces)
This is the "Sandbox."
- `Papers/`: Shared collection of research papers we are studying (e.g., Evaluating the Explainers, Fairness in Student Prediction).
- Individual Workspaces:
  - 👤 [Istiaq](https://github.com/Istiaq-Alam): Working on LSTM models, XAI methods (SHAP, LIME, DICE), and `fairsynedu`.
  - 👤 [Nazme](https://github.com/Nazme10): Literature review and initial drafts.
  - 👤 [Maria](https://github.com/mariafardus): Summaries of academic performance prediction papers.

3. `Thesis_Paper`
Contains the academic output.
- LaTeX source files.
- High-resolution figures generated from the CodeBase.
